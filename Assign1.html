    <div class="unorderlist1">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline- By using the style attribute inside HTML Elements</li>
            <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
            <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, <mark>in this
                    tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark> because this is easier to demonstrate,and
                easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

        <div class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple
            elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use
            a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</div>
        <div class="p2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once
            an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</div>
        <div class="p3">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both
            are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</div>
